Trigger Tracking App

The purpose of this app is to track the relationship between symptoms and triggers, to see what could be triggering or worsening symptoms. Users can enter a list of their symptoms and possible triggers. Users can then rate the severity of each symptom, along with which triggers they experienced that day. Once there is enough data to demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between a trigger and symptoms, the user can view a list of their significant triggers and bar charts that show the difference in symptom severity when the trigger is present versus absent.
